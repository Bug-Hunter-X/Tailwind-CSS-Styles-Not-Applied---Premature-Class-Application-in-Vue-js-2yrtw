The solution is to ensure Tailwind classes are applied after the component is rendered within the template section of your Vue component.
```vue
<template>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 text-white"></div>
</template>

<script>
export default {};
</script>
```
Alternatively, use the `v-bind` directive (`:class`) within the template to dynamically apply classes, but only after the component has been mounted and rendered:
```vue
<template>
  <div :class="['bg-blue-500', dynamicClass]"></div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      dynamicClass: 'text-white'
    };
  },
  mounted() {
    // Ensure dynamicClass is correctly applied after component mount
    // This might be needed in some complex scenarios where reactivity might not immediately work 
     this.$nextTick(() => {
      console.log('Component mounted, dynamic class should apply now');
    });
  }
};
</script>
```
